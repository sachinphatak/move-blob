# move-blob
Move a blob around with arrow keys or on-screen buttons. Something I'm using to practice testing a node-express-angular app.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo.
2. 'cd' into the folder you've cloned the repo into.
3. Type 'npm install' on the command line.
4. Open 'localhost:8000' on your browser and start moving the blob!
